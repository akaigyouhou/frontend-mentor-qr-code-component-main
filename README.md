## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I use background-image to load the origin design picture to see wether the layout match.
The result seems good.
But I just wonder is there any other methods.
